Secure Checkout Process: Implement a streamlined and secure booking and payment confirmation flow.
User Authentication: Enable users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

Project Structure & Requirements
1. Project Initialization
GitHub Repository Setup: A clean and well-organized GitHub repository will be set up.
Comprehensive README: This README file will serve as the central documentation, providing an overview, setup instructions, and project guidelines.
2. UI/UX Design Planning
A strong emphasis is placed on user-centric design to ensure an intuitive and engaging experience.

Design Goals:
Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow.
Maintain visual consistency across all pages and components.
Ensure fast loading times for an optimal user experience.
Prioritize a mobile-first approach for responsiveness.
Key Features (UI/UX Focus):
Property search and filtering
Detailed property viewing
Secure checkout process
User authentication

3. Figma Design Specifications
Our design will adhere to the following specifications for visual consistency:

Color Styles:
Primary: #FF5A5F (AirBnB Red)
Secondary: #008489 (Teal/Green)
Background: #FFFFFF (White)
Text: #222222 (Dark Grey)
Secondary Text: #717171 (Medium Grey)
Typography (Font: Circular):
Primary Font: Medium (500), 16px
Headings: Bold (700), 24px-32px
Secondary Text: Book (400), 14px

Project Roles and Responsibilities
Our team will operate with defined roles to ensure efficient development and clear accountability:

Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, and manages overall deliverables.
Frontend Developers: Implements UI components, integrates with backend APIs, and ensures responsive and accessible design.
Backend Developers: Builds robust APIs, manages database interactions, and implements core business logic.
Designers: Creates mockups, maintains the design system, and ensures an optimal user experience (UX quality).
QA/Testers: Writes and executes test cases, performs comprehensive testing, and reports bugs.
DevOps Engineers: Manages deployment processes, sets up CI/CD pipelines, and configures server infrastructure.
Product Owner: Defines project requirements, prioritizes features, and represents stakeholder interests.
Scrum Master: Facilitates agile processes, helps remove blockers, and organizes team meetings and sprints.

UI Component Patterns
We will implement a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.

Planned Components:
Navbar:
Logo
Search bar
User navigation (profile, login/signup links)
Responsive menu for mobile views
Property Card:
Property image with carousel functionality
Basic details (price per night, location, rating)
Favorite button
Designed for a responsive grid layout
Footer:
Essential site links
Company information
Social media links
Copyright information
Each component will be designed for maximum reusability and to maintain visual consistency throughout the application.

Best Practices & Quality Assurance
Our development process will strictly adhere to the following best practices:

Code Organization: Maintain a clean, modular, and well-structured codebase.
Version Control: Utilize Git and GitHub with feature branches for new development and clear, meaningful commit messages.
Responsive Design: Implement a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal viewing across all devices.
Accessibility: Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the application is usable by everyone.
Documentation: Keep all project documentation (including this README) updated, clear, and comprehensive.
Testing: Implement a robust testing strategy including unit tests for individual components/functions and integration tests for larger features to ensure reliability and prevent bugs.
